Bhai dekho sabko lagta h shiv ji karte h nashe hamesh aisa nhi h  ,
I am telling you context of shivji & substance realtion;
.
.
SAMUDRA MANTHAN k baad shiv ji ne vudh Piya tha jis wajah se unke body mein heat bahut bhadne lagi thi jis wajah se normal rehne par pain experience ho raha tha toh unko thoda unconscious karne k liye jisse dard par unka dhyaan na jaaye isliye unko BHANG aur substance diya gaya tha .
.
.
.
SHIV JI IS IDEAL OF BEIN POWERFUL ,
unse hi seekh milti h kapdo se farak nhi padta , POWER se hi hota h ;
for eg he used to do meditation toh shamshan mein bhi rehte the lekin jab PAARVATI MAA ne kaha unko Ghar chaiye toh POORA SONE KI LANKA banwadiye the SHIV JI .

Suffering is because of Sin, once sin is ?? suffering will also be ??

Ever Lied?
Ever Disrespected Parents?
Ever Got angry on people?(anger=murder)
Ever Stolen?
Ever Lusted after someone?(lust=adultery)

Because Everyone has sinned against God and became worthy of death(?Rom 6:23) but God being a Loving Father sent His only beloved Son for us on the Cross?? to be Sacrificed as a ransom for our sins(We committed crime, Jesus paid fine ?John 3:16). And now whoever believes and accepts Jesus as his Lord and Saviour, he/she is granted freedom from sin, Everlasting life, peace?, love? and joy?? and a relationship with the Eternal God.

another thing is that (apart from the studio audience) the people watching online couldn't connect it at the level desired because lack of Hindi (local language) words. (its not about gender specific, but) Men tends to use Hindi words for things that could be well connected with the online audience (including the studio audience) such as using G**nd instead of As*hole would connect way better (in my opinion)... cheers!!",negative,1

"Hey, are you the same RV whose write-ups appear on the editorial pages of the Sunday (or other) Times of India?

Cannot figure out if that same (sometimes over the top) sense of humour gal is you?
I particularly remember how you wrote on bisexuality or the Indian laws on LGBTQ ways of lifestyle and am slightly 'disturbed' (sorry, my English being poor im using disturbed, but it is a mix of emotions).

Maybe you are the 80s or 90s kid (i too grew up or had my teenage years in 1990s btw) but this still did not make sense (to the extent you were 'trying' to make it happen) that couples still make it such a taboo or be fussy over farting or taking a dump/number 2!

Have you seen the trend of these new (shitty as hell) social experiment or entertainment video channels even on youtube? Kids talking of BDSM and commenting on even their parents' habits in bed.. and here you are being cheesy (in parts) about ..well it was a big deal maybe back in our day.
But kids/couples today.. I assume.. don't give a shit to shitting.

You are nice, I loved your writing for most parts through the years (even when i may not have agreed to the content of few pieces you wrote in TOI), but in this particular act.. i may be wrong.. but i found it to be overly loud at times.

The few women who did comment spoke quite complimentary things of her. 
There is a very large chance that you guys didn't realise that perhaps, this matter isn't targeted at you. It's targeted at women. It's humour made for women who understand what growing up in these situations was like.

It is not about woman sacrificing food and water, it is a form of showing their love and care towards their husband.

"Well you do look like a fake of something.

Now, let's come to your whatever this is. To paraphrase, ""Karva Chauth which you refer it as Karva Chut is only designed for non-working women who host boring gatherings with other b!tches(Feminists should kill themselves here if they didn't die already when you reduced women you are referring to vag!na), longing for better cunnilingus technique from their husbands. These women need to give up worrying about their partners cause according to you they only use one of the Microsoft Office applications, PowerPoint(all the technology you been using to share your content created from just using PowerPoint, isn't it?) and yada yada BS and you end it with an advice for these women to get better at oral skills for a happy marriage.""

My first question, are you married? I mean happily married? Happy would be a far fetch with a person like you though. You made a stand up about dating a guy at your late forties, so I take the liberty to assume that you aren't. So, what makes you an expert on marriages and how to be happy in them? Perhaps you'd be thinking going through several men/women makes you an expert. It does but not in marriage. I'm no expert either but pretty sure it does not depend on cunnilingus techniques or oral skills. 

Second, what's your problem with non-working women? What makes you think if they aren't working at a firm, they are sitting at home idle watching sh!tty content like yours? They are not dependent on you for survival, are they? If they were, they would starve to death with your 11K subscribers and more than 90% dislike ratio in late forties. And you are using tastiest and juiciest thing in the world, the chut as a slur. So, feminism is only when you want to criticize men or women who don't fit your definition, is it? I could see only one chut here and that's you. An old looking, unfunny, failed stand-up and writer chut. 

And let me end up with an advice as well. If you want to be a good stand up, stop stereotyping people and get your head out of your butt. That usually helps.",negative,1

Once you have an image then think of all the things that you have said being applied to them.
